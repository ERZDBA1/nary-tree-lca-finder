# N-ary Tree LCA & LDCA Finder

This repository contains code for finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) and Lowest Dominating Common Ancestors (LDCAs) in an n-ary tree.

## Usage

- **LCA:** Use `NaryTreeLCAFinder.findLCA(TreeNode root, Set<TreeNode> nodes)` to find the lowest common ancestor of the given nodes.
- **LDCAs:** Use `NaryTreeLCAFinder.findLDCAs(TreeNode root, Set<TreeNode> nodes)` to find the lowest dominating common ancestors of the given nodes.
